# Controller settings
#
# This is the default profile for each controller.
# Multiple controllers slots are defined by increasing the number.

# Controller sections contain:
#  Key: A option, these are the same options that can used on the command line
#       but without the "--" prefix.
#  Value: The option's value, should be "true" if no value is needed.

# Profiles
#
# Profiles allows switching controller settings during runtime.

# Mappings
#
# Mappings let you map buttons and sticks to mouse, key and joystick events.

# Mapping sections always require a name and are then enabled in a profile

# Bindings
#

# on all profiles.
#
# Sections contains:
#  Key: A button combo
#  Value: An action, see next section for valid actions.
#
#
# Valid actions:
#  next-profile                                  Loads the next profile
#  prev-profile                                  Loads the previous profile
#  load-profile <profile>                        Loads the specified profile
#  exec <command> [arg1] [arg2] ...              Executes the command with
#                                                specified arguments
#  exec-background <command> [arg1] [arg2] ...   Same as exec but launches in
#                                                the background
#
#
# Actions will be pre-processed and replace variables with real values.
#
# Valid variables:
#  $profile                The current profile
#  $name                   Pretty name of the current device
#  $device_addr            Bluetooth address of the device
#  $report.<attribute>     Replace <attribute> with a valid attribute,
